### MIGUEL SÁNCHEZ DE LEÓN PEQUE
#### Language: EN
## Description

Nowadays Python is the perfect environment for developing a real-time automated trading tool. In this talk we will discuss the development of: a general-purpose multiagent-system module using Pyro and ZeroMQ; a platform, based on it, for developing automated trading strategies using Numpy, Numba, Theano, etc.; and a GUI for visualizing real-time market data using PyQtGraph and Qt.
